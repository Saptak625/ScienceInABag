## Scientific Concept
A chemical reaction is when an initial substance, the reactant, undergoes a chemical change to produce a completely new substance, the product, by the breaking and forming of bonds between atoms.
PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) in glue, borate ions from baking soda + contact lens solution, and water react to form the product, slime!

## Real-World Application
From digestion of food, to baking, to photosynthesis, and to power plants, chemical reactions occur everywhere! They play a major role in constituting how the world works.
