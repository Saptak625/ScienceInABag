# Marshmallow Tower
Can You Build the Tallest Marshmallow Tower? How much weight can it take? In this activity, your young engineers will use their creativity and problem-solving skills to build the tallest marshmallow tower possible.

## Materials
* Regular sized marshmallows
* Toothpicks
* Phone or Timer
* Light-weight objects to test the tower's strength (e.g. paper clips, coins, etc.)

## Instructions
1. Spread the supplies out on a table.
2. Set a timer for 20 minutes.
3. Rip marshmallows into smaller pieces.
4. Use toothpicks(as beams) and marshmallows(as joints) to create the tallest tower in the limited time.
5. Once the time is up, test the tower's strength by placing light-weight objects on top of it.

## Scientific Concept
Young scientists will develop engineering and critical thinking skills by implementing concepts like center of mass. They will learn what shapes and structures are strong and stable. They will also learn about the importance of soft skills such as teamwork and communication. 

## Real-World Application
This activity is a great way to introduce young scientists to the world of engineering. They will learn about the import role of engineers, specifically civil, in our society and how they can make a difference in the world.
