# Fire Egg
Can eggs move by themselves? Maybe not, but with the help of air pressure, they can be pushed into a glass bottle without being touched! In this experiment, your young scientists will learn about density and air pressure.

## Materials
* Hard-boiled egg
* Glass bottle (Opening wide enough for egg to fit, but small enough to hold it)
* Match

## Instructions
1. Light a match on fire.
2. Drop it in the bottle.
3. Quickly place the egg on the bottle opening before the match goes out.
4. Watch the egg get vacuumed.

## Scientific Concept
When a fire burns, it consumes the oxygen around it which is why the flame keeps burning. When the match is placed in the bottle and the egg is placed on top, the match's fire can only take in the oxygen inside the bottle. When the oxygen in the bottle is being consumed, the oxygen outside the bottle has a greater pressure and tries to get in the bottle. This creates such a large push on the egg that it gets pushed into the bottle.

## Real-World Application
Vacuum cleaners create a difference in pressure between the inside and outside of the vacuum cleaner. This causes the air to rush into the vacuum cleaner and carry the dust and dirt with it. This is how vacuum cleaners clean your house.
