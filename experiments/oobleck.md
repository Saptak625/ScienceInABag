# Oobleck
Oobleck is a strange substance that is sometimes a solid and sometimes a liquid. In this experiment, your young scientists will learn about the properties of Oobleck and how it can be used to create moving objects.

## Materials
* Cornstarch (1 cup)
* Water (3/4 cup)
* Food coloring (optional)
* Plastic bowl or bin

## Instructions
1. Pour cornstarch into the container.
2. Pour water over the cornstarch.
3. Stir using the stick until uniformly mixed.

## Scientific Concept
Oobleck is a non-Newtonian fluid. This means that it does not follow Newton's law of viscosity. Newton's law of viscosity states that the shear stress of a fluid is proportional to the velocity gradient of the fluid. This means that the faster you move a fluid, the more shear stress it will have. Oobleck does not follow this law because it is a suspension of cornstarch and water. The cornstarch particles are suspended in the water and when you move it slowly, the cornstarch particles can move out of the way. However, when you move it quickly, the cornstarch particles cannot move out of the way fast enough and the fluid becomes more solid.

## Real-World Application
Oobleck is used in bulletproof vests. When a bullet hits the vest, the oobleck particles move out of the way and absorb the bullet's energy. This prevents the bullet from penetrating the vest and injuring the person wearing it.
